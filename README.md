# Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built to showcase projects, skills, and provide a way for others to get in touch. The website is currently under development, but here’s what’s available so far:

## Current Features:
- **Home Page**: An introduction to who I am and a brief overview of my work.
- **Projects Page**: A collection of my projects, including descriptions and links to the code or live demos.
- **Contact Page**: A simple contact form where visitors can reach out.
- **Theme Toggle**: Users can switch between different themes (e.g., light and dark mode).

## What's Coming:
- More detailed project descriptions and case studies.
- Expanded contact form with more interactive elements.
- Additional animations and design improvements.

The development is ongoing, and new features will be added soon to enhance user experience!
